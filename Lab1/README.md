# ITWS-2110-F25-WeatherVane-Lab-1

This lab contains both the group and individual portfolio sites that were created for lab 1 of ITWS-2110

Work Log:
-----------------------------------------------
Sawyer:

To complete this lab, I used the format that Kat had provided in order to personalize and style my personal portfolio site as well as the group portfolio site.

On several occassions I did not remember exact HTML syntax so i had to refer to:
- previous ITWS/personal work
- w3schools.com 

These references were mostly for syntax but I also used w3 schools for a bit of css styling help, such as making a link not be blue/purple and inheriting the color of its larger div

For the little javascript i did(member box on hover), i relied mostly on w3schools as well as my intro to ITWS term project.
