# ITWS-2110-F25-WeatherVane-Lab-2

This lab contains the constitution website that was created for lab 2 of ITWS-2110

Sawyer's README.md:
-----------------------------------------------

Work Log:

 - Copied down entirity of constitution's content: all was copy pasted from https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/

 - A div was set for each article/amendment with h1 used to title each and h2 used to title each section within them
 - Each div was given either "article" or "amendment" class while all h1 and h2 were not given classes as they remain to be titles and section respectively

 - Used CSS and javascript to make collapseable sections for each article and amendment, added an analysis button for each section that reveals the analysis of the specific section

 - Analysis of amendments: 1, 2, 3, & 5

 - Used W3Schools for all css and javascript help

Ryan's README.md:

Work Log:

- Mainly used Sawyer's CSS styles and the full constitution text.

- Performed analysis of Article 1 and Amendment 4. Amendment 4 was relatively quick and simple; however, Article 1 posed some challenges. For one, it had many sections (10 to be exact),
  so I had to create headers for each section and an indentation div class to make it more readable (or else it would look too messy and unorganized, which I experimented with initially). Another
  problem I faced was the ending text of "State Restrictions" being slightly cut off at the end of the analysis tab, so I solved this by creating another div class with a bottom padding of 50 to make
  it more visually appealing.

 - Continuing from the previous bullet point, Article 1 was revised several times by later Amendments, and so I had to look at other places in the Constitution for reference and compare with my points.
   After doing so, if necessary, I placed a parenthesis indicating that the rule was later changed.

- Did not use any external help other than W3Schools padding-bottom.
