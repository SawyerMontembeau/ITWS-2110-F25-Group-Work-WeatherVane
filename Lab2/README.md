Work Log:

 - Copied down entirity of constitution's content: all was copy pasted from https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/

 - A div was set for each article/amendment with h1 used to title each and h2 used to title each section within them
 - Each div was given either "article" or "amendment" class while all h1 and h2 were not given classes as they remain to be titles and section respectively

 - Used CSS and javascript to make collapseable sections for each article and amendment, added an analysis button for each section that reveals the analysis of the specific section

 -Analysis of amendments: 1, 2, 3, & 5

 - Used W3Schools for all css and javascript help
