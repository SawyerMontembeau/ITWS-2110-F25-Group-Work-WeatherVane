# ITWS-2110-F25-WeatherVane-Lab-2

This lab contains the constitution website that was created for lab 2 of ITWS-2110

Sawyer's README.md:
-----------------------------------------------

Work Log:

 - Copied down entirity of constitution's content: all was copy pasted from https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/

 - A div was set for each article/amendment with h1 used to title each and h2 used to title each section within them
 - Each div was given either "article" or "amendment" class while all h1 and h2 were not given classes as they remain to be titles and section respectively

 - Used CSS and javascript to make collapseable sections for each article and amendment, added an analysis button for each section that reveals the analysis of the specific section

 - Analysis of amendments: 1, 2, 3, & 5

 - Used W3Schools for all css and javascript help

Ryan's README.md:

Work Log:

- Mainly used Sawyer's CSS styles and the full constitution text.

- Performed analysis of Article 1 and Amendment 4. Amendment 4 was relatively quick and simple; however, Article 1 posed some challenges. For one, it had many sections (10 to be exact),
  so I had to create headers for each section and an indentation div class to make it more readable (or else it would look too messy and unorganized, which I experimented with initially). Another
  problem I faced was the ending text of "State Restrictions" being slightly cut off at the end of the analysis tab, so I solved this by creating another div class with a bottom padding of 50 to make
  it more visually appealing.

 - Continuing from the previous bullet point, Article 1 was revised several times by later Amendments, and so I had to look at other places in the Constitution for reference and compare with my points.
   After doing so, if necessary, I placed a parenthesis indicating that the rule was later changed.

- Did not use any external help other than W3Schools padding-bottom.

Kat's README.md:
-----------------------------------------------

Work log:

- Made use of Sawyer's initial groundwork (constitution.html formatting, JavaScripting, and CSS) to contribute my analysis.

- Analyzed Articles II and V, as well as the 10th Amendment, offering a broadstrokes summary of each while providing a meaningful interpretation of their most important points.

- I created history.html ("History of the Constitution" page) where I wrote a top-down summary of the most important aspects of the Constitution's history. Additionally, I included a pertinent quote by President Barack Obama at the bottom of the page.

- I added a few additional CSS classes as was necessary (styling the history.html page, the clickable links in the header, and the quote)

Overall, this lab was not terribly difficult. The only part that was considerably time-consuming was the analysis of the Constitution itself.
Additionally, since I am generally the team member responsible for CSS styling and the like, it was a bit challenging to work around Sawyer's CSS. However, I feel like being able to understand and manipulate someone else's work, meanwhile preserving the spirit of their code/aesthetic choices, is an important skill for me to cultivate. This lab certainly helped me work on this.

MJ's README.md:

Work log:

As with my other groupmates I used the HTML / CSS / JS structure that Sawyer provided. Adding my analysis felt intuitive, particularly with content.innerHTML and the += operator. I thought this was an efficient solution that saved the headache of placing all the text in one div.

I was responsible for the analysis of Articles III and IV as well as Amendments VIII and IX. The amendments were short but I found that they could be extrapolated considerably. Article IV was the longest portion I had (with 4 sections), but not overwhelmingly so. I found it appropriate to keep in certain terminology (e.g. extradition, appellate jurisdiction) but explain them in simpler terms.

My main point of reference was Congress.gov's Consitution Annotated website, and replicated the titles they had for each section of the articles. For example, they named Section 1 of Article IV "Full Faith and Credit Clause".

Work log:
For for this project, I jumped into the same setup my group was using - the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework that Sawyer put together. It actually worked out pretty smoothly! I figured out how to add my sections using content.innerHTML and the += operator, which was a lifesaver. It meant I could just plug my text right into the page without dealing with a giant, messy HTML file.

My job was to break down Article VI, Article VII, and the 6th and 7th Amendments. I had to really think about how to explain them clearly without getting too technical. Article VI was the big one with a few sections to get through. I tried to keep it more understandable by using plain language.

For my research, I mostly went on Congress.gov Constitution Annotated site. it was helpful for getting the official info and section names right.

All in all, it was cool to take these historic documents and make them actually understandable for people today. I think my sections turned out pretty clear and fit well with what the rest of the group was doing!
