    <p>
      The United States Constitution is the nation’s supreme law, forming the foundation of American government and democracy. Drafted in 1787 and ratified in 1788, it established the framework for the federal government, outlined the separation of powers, and guaranteed certain rights to the people. It remains the oldest written national constitution still in use.
    </p>
    <h2>From the Articles of Confederation to a Stronger Union</h2>
    <p>
      After declaring independence in 1776, the thirteen former colonies first governed themselves under the Articles of Confederation (ratified in 1781). While the Articles created a loose confederation of states, they left the national government extremely weak: Congress had no power to tax, regulate trade, or enforce laws. Economic troubles, interstate disputes, and uprisings like Shays’ Rebellion (1786–87) highlighted the need for a stronger central government.
    </p>
    <h2>The Constitutional Convention of 1787</h2>
    <p>
      In May 1787, delegates from twelve states (all but Rhode Island) met in Philadelphia to revise the Articles. Instead, they decided to draft an entirely new governing document. Over the course of four months, the Constitutional Convention debated questions of representation, federal vs. state power, and how to balance liberty with effective government.
      Key compromises shaped the Constitution:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Great Compromise created a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the House of Representatives and equal representation in the Senate.</li>
        <li>The Three-Fifths Compromise determined how enslaved people would be counted for representation and taxation.</li>
        <li>Checks and balances were built into the structure of government, dividing powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was signed by 39 of the 55 delegates.</p>

    <h2>Ratification and the Bill of Rights</h2>
    <p>
      The Constitution required ratification by nine of the thirteen states to take effect. Fierce debates followed between Federalists, who supported the new framework, and Anti-Federalists, who feared centralized power and the lack of explicit protections for individual rights.
      The Federalist Papers—essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay—helped persuade the public to support ratification. To secure enough support, Federalists promised to add a Bill of Rights once the Constitution was adopted.
      By June 1788, the ninth state (New Hampshire) ratified the document, bringing it into effect. In 1791, the first ten amendments—known as the Bill of Rights—were added, guaranteeing freedoms such as speech, religion, and due process.  
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution Through Amendments</h2>
    <p>
      Since 1789, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. These amendments have addressed issues ranging from civil rights to voting rights to presidential term limits. Notable examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 13th Amendment (1865), abolishing slavery.</li>
        <li>The 14th Amendment (1868), guaranteeing equal protection under the law.</li>
        <li>The 19th Amendment (1920), granting women the right to vote.</li>
        <li>The 26th Amendment (1971), lowering the voting age to 18.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The amendment process, outlined in Article V, makes the Constitution flexible enough to adapt to new challenges while preserving its core structure.</p>
